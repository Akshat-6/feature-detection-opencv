Implementation of keypoint detection and matching using SIFT, SURF, and Corner Detection algorithms with OpenCV for feature extraction and comparison.

🔍 Feature Detection using SIFT, SURF & Corner Detection | OpenCV


This project demonstrates the use of feature detection algorithms—SIFT, SURF, and Harris Corner Detection—to extract and compare key points across images for various computer vision tasks like matching, registration, and motion tracking.



📌 Objective


Detect and visualize important features in images

Match features between image pairs

Compare the behavior and performance of SIFT, SURF, and Harris Corner Detector
